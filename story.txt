On a sunny afternoon, a lone traveler went searching for an authentic Bratwurst. 
He was driving his porsche down Hauptsrtasse wearing his lederhose.
He put the top down to get some sunshine as he listened to his favorite band Rammstein. 
He took a sip of Kaffee and smiled at the sight of the old Schloss on the horizon.
“Truly, the best time of the year in Berlin,” the traveler thought, as the comforting aroma of the nearby baeckerei washed through his car. 
He pulled over to the baeckeri and went inside. Since that day, he has brought his friends and family to the same baeckeri.
The sunny weather in Cairo is ideal for Biergarten-style outdoor dining experiences, where fresh Brot and Gebaeck are always on the table.
With renewed energy from the bakery's fresh Brot, he spotted a small Imbiss where the authentic Bratwurst he'd been searching for awaited him.
He then enjoyed the authentic Bratwurst at the old Schloss with a Hund he saw in the Hauptstrasse.
